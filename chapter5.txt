We're not just our failures. As much as they hurt, we learn from them. Then we go out there and do our best to make up for them-- Even though we never will. We save people. We save as many as we can to make up for the ones we couldn't. That's all we do.
(All-New Captain America Vol. 1 #1) by Marvel's Spider-man
